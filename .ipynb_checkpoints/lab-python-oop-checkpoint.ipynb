Every time a new BankAccount object is created, the account_count attribute is incremented by one. This can be useful for various purposes, such as generating unique account numbers or monitoring the growth of a bank's customer base.*"

    "- deduct_fees() - deducts transaction fees from the account balance based on the number of transactions made in the current month and the transaction fee per transaction. The method calculates the total fees by multiplying the transaction count with the transaction fee, and deducts the fees from the account balance if it's sufficient. If the balance is insufficient, it prints an error message. Otherwise, it prints how much it's been deducted. After deducting the fees, the method resets the transaction count to 0.\n",
    "- reset_transactions() - resets the transaction count to 0\n",
    "- get_transaction_count() - returns the current transaction count for the account\n",

    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a CheckingAccount class that inherits from the BankAccount class and has the above attributes and methods.\n",
    "- Test the class by creating a few instances of CheckingAccount and making deposits, withdrawals, and transactions to deduct fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: To ensure that the transaction count is updated every time a deposit or withdrawal is made, we need to overwrite the deposit and withdraw methods inherited from the BankAccount class. "
